## What is MiSTer FPGA?

**MiSTer** is an open source project that aims to recreate various classic computers, game consoles, and arcade machines using modern hardware. It allows software and game images to run as they would on original hardware, using peripherals such as mice, keyboards, joysticks and other game controllers.  
MiSTer utilizes a readily available FPGA board called the [DE10-Nano](http://de10-nano.terasic.com){target=_blank}, which connects to your TV or monitor via HDMI video out. It can also be expanded with various [add-on boards](basics/addons.md){target=_blank}, such as a 7-port USB hub, 128MB SDRAM module, and either a Digital I/O or Analog I/O board.  
The MiSTer project is currently under active development with new cores, features, and bug-fixes appearing on a regular basis.

Check the navigation sidebar to the left for documentation on how to use your MiSTer FPGA. Feel free to join the official [MiSTer FPGA Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MiSTerFPGA){target=_blank} and head to the [MiSTer FPGA Discussion Forums](https://misterfpga.org){target=_blank} to learn more and participate in the community.
